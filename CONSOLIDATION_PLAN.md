# Project Consolidation Plan

## Current Status
We currently have two project structures:
1. **Root Project**: Original React/Electron app with Redux setup and detailed database models
2. **POS Directory**: Modern Next.js implementation with Tailwind CSS and better UI components

## Consolidation Strategy
We will consolidate around the Next.js implementation in the `/POS` directory while preserving valuable components from the original project.

## Action Items

### 1. Copy Important Files from Original Project
- Database models from `src/lib/db/models/*` â†’ `POS/lib/models/`
- Any unique functionality from the original project

### 2. Remove Duplicate Projects
- Archive or remove the original project files after migration

### 3. Move Next.js Implementation to Root
- Move all files from `/POS` to the project root
- Update import paths as needed

### 4. Integrate Redux into Next.js Project
- Use Redux toolkit with Next.js
- Create proper reducers and actions based on the existing store setup

### 5. Connect IndexedDB with Models
- Use the detailed models from the original project with the IndexedDB implementation

## Implementation Timeline
1. Copy valuable components from original project (1 day)
2. Set up database models in POS project (1 day)
3. Move POS project to root (1 day)
4. Clean up and testing (1 day)

## Result
A single, unified project with:
- Modern Next.js frontend
- Proper state management with Redux
- Complete database models and IndexedDB implementation
- Clean, maintainable code structure
