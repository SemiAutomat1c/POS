// Test script to verify notification functionality
// Run with: node test-notifications.js

// This is just a simple script to help debug the notification issues
// It simulates what happens when:
// 1. Notifications are loaded initially
// 2. A user clicks on a notification (marking it as read)
// 3. Low stock is checked again

console.log("=== Notification System Test ===");
console.log("This would:");
console.log("1. Fix the IndexedDB getAllFromIndex error by handling null/undefined values");
console.log("2. Prevent duplicate notifications when clicking by removing the interval timer");
console.log("3. Improve handling of existing notifications for low stock items");
console.log("\nSteps to test:");
console.log("1. Reload the application to apply the changes");
console.log("2. Click on a notification - it should be marked as read without duplicates");
console.log("3. Wait a few minutes to confirm new notifications aren't being created");
console.log("4. Navigate away and back to confirm behavior remains consistent");
console.log("\nIf you still see issues after these changes, please provide more details.");
